								<h3>Planck Keyboard</h3>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/keyboard/P1060132.JPG" alt="" /></span>Ortholinear is a semi-made-up word that was originally coined (to my knowledge) by TypeMatrix as "ortho-linear" - this term got concatenated, became popular among the keyboard community, and eventually became the banner for a keyboard company!
It refers to keyboard layouts where the keys are aligned vertically and horizontally, compared to standard staggered keyboards. No studies have been done to test the ergonomics of ortholinear keyboards (versus a comparable staggered one), but the change can make it easier to design and visual custom keymaps, and may help relieve RSI symptoms. source:<br><a href="http://olkb.com/" class="button special">OLKB.com</a></p>

								<p>it was a simple assembly, pcb was perfect, just put on the keys and used the brass plates to hold it all together,  i did find the cedar center was poorly thought out.  What should have been 4 boards jointed together to form a rectangle, was one larger board with the center milled out,  this left 2 ends showing end grain, and its only 1/8 in thick, it was not going to last any time being handeled. so I make a new wood center out of small piece of Wenge i had in the shop, what was left i turned into a wrist rest.</p>
								<p>General typing on the keyboard was easy to pick up, i programmed it so the raised layer has a keypad for numbers, and that makes numbers easy, but the symbols are still hard to find sometimes, i put the common ones i use for coding where i can remember but every now and then i need to type a ^ or find my print screen button and it slows me down.  This is my first mech keyboard build, and I like the size, i love the cherry blues my last keyboard was a full sized cherry brown gaming keyboard.</p>

I designed / dug / did plumbing and electrical, but contracted out the steel, concrete, tile, and pebble tech. </p>

								<h4>tv cabninet</h4>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/tvcab/P1040862.JPG" alt="" /></span>had to give my tv gear:1 more air, and 2 IR path that was not obstructed.  step one, cut out the wood panels from the cabninet doors.</p>

								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/tvcab/P1040863.JPG" alt="" /></span>clean up the doors to make room for some speaker cloth</p>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/tvcab/P1040865.JPG" alt="" /></span>used scrap wood to wedge in the speaker cloth, it is cheap and is just a tight screen.  this was super easy to install</p>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/tvcab/P1040867.JPG" alt="" /></span>reinstalled the doors, looks great.  you can also see the pc fans i installed under the cabninet, cut some holes in the back of the cabninet bottom to push the air up the back of the cabninet to then flow over the gear and out the screen.</p>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/tvcab/P1040868.JPG" alt="" /></span>doors open to reveal the mess! ps3, nas, amp, tivo, network and tv gear, has been cool ever since!</p>
